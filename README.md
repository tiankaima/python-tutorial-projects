# python-tutorial-projects

This repository contains a collection of projects that I wrote when teaching my friend Python.

The projects are designed to be simple and easy to understand, but also to cover a wide range of topics.
(Although, some part of that is just their homework... so, also credit to their teachers and TAs for their assignments.)

Also worth mentioning, I personally don't like paid courses for python, and **I would rather avoid my examples being used in paid courses**.
But still, it's licensed under MIT for most ppl's convience, so I can't really stop you from doing that.
But please, if you are making a paid course, think twice before using my examples, also considering cut out the part where you mentioned this code as free video if you can. Thanks.
